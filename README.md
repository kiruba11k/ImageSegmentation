# Image Segmentation using U-Net

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for semantic image segmentation using the U-Net architecture. The project focuses on pixel-wise classification of  images to accurately delineate regions of interest. 

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Built and trained a U-Net model optimized for semantic segmentation tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilized OpenCV for resizing, normalization, and augmentation of large-scale image datasets.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated model performance using IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Coefficient.
- **Visualization:** Created detailed visualizations to showcase segmentation accuracy and effectiveness.

## Applications
In the real world, Image Segmentation helps in many applications in 
- medical science,
- self-driven cars,
- imaging of satellites and many more.

Image Segmentation works by studying the image at the lowest level.
